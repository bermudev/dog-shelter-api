# Dog Shelter API built with Flask and Python

## What does the API do?

Here's a short list explaining what the updated version of the API does:

- Allows users to register for an account and authenticate themselves using user and password. Some endpoints are protected after authentication and administration permissions.
- Allows users to manage dogs by adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting dogs, as well as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting information about their adoption status, vaccinations, and health status.
- Provides API documentation in Swagger using Flask-Smorest.
- Provides informative error messages in case of failed requests.
- Uses SQLite as the database management system to store and manage the data.

## Flask resources and technologies used

Some of the Flask tools used for the creation of these APIs are:

- **Flask-Smorest** for automatic API documentation, defining serialization and data validation schemes, and for simplified resource definition.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** to define database models, create database connections and execute SQL queries.
- **Flask-JWT** for authentication and authorization based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Database design

This is going to be the final design of the project database, I have expanded the original idea and modified some fields with the suggestions of some dog-loving friends. It does not include the user part for login.
